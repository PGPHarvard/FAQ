# Specimens/Sequencing
### In what order are participants sequenced? 
Once you have passed the enrollment requirements for participation in the PGP, there are no selection or prioritization criteria other than "the ability to give a sample at a collection event" that determine whether a participant would potentially have a genome sequenced and returned to them. There is no prioritization in response to donations, and also no prioritization based on when a participant joined the project (i.e. there is no "queue"). Sequencing is still a costly and time-consuming process, and it occurs as resources are available. 

While we don’t prioritize sequencing in return for donations, participants are welcome to pursue sequencing through third parties and donate their data to the PGP http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html or participate in the recently announced sequencing opportunity for PGP participants through Veritas Genetics http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veritas-genetics-breaks-1000-whole-genome-barrier-300150585.html

### When will my genome be available? 
All blood samples collected in our blood collection events over the past year or more are in the sequencing pipeline. Some are awaiting sequencing and are safely stored in our freezers, and some are at various stages of the actual sequencing process. 

As you know, sequencing is a lengthy and complex process, and once the sequencing is complete, there is still more that has to be done on our end before your genome is ready to be released to you. Our staff is small, so we have to do the work in batches, thus making the process take longer than we wish it would, and it can often take a year or more. 

### I gave a blood sample, why isn’t it showing on my profile?
We apologize if your profile does not reflect your sample donation. Please don't be concerned. All donated bllod samples have been logged. Unfortunately, due to our small staff, updating the site to reflect the donation can take time. If too much time has passed, and your sample donation is still not reflected on your profile, please let us know. 

### Whatever happened to my saliva sample?
Several years ago the PGP collected saliva samples from many PGP participants. Those samples are still safely banked, and that is incredibly valuable data that we hope to utilize one day. 

We are a small but growing study, sequencing is costly, and technology is changing rapidly. What we initially set out to do has conceptually stayed constant. However, how we are getting there has had to shift based on real-world variables that are not always within our control. 

We want to impress upon you that your support and efforts have not been wasted at all, and we do not take it for granted. Although it may personally feel that your individual investment has been underutilized until this point, your willingness to join the PGP and to donate samples (whether they were ever sequenced or not) combined with all the other individuals willing to do so, has helped prove to donors and investors that ours is a project worth investing in. 

Our increasing success at this stage is in large part due to many individuals coming together in good faith over the past decade. If you have been following recent events of the Harvard PGP, you will have noticed blood collection events starting to occur across the country, and we only expect those to increase over time and in more locations. In addition, PersonalGenomes.org has recently announced a new location in Austria, adding a fourth member to the family as well as the introduction of OpenHumans.org https://www.openhumans.org  

Our team of researchers are continually seeking funding for sequencing and forging new relationships with industry partners in the hopes of bringing innovative solutions to participant sequencing needs. 

### Test Kit Requests
Participants often ask us if they can send us samples via a “kit” or through a lab or physician in their area. Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to accept blood unless it is collected in one of our group events.  Our scale is really small right now, and processing occurs in batches, so group collection events are our only practical method for blood sample collections at this point. 

We will definitely be letting you know about upcoming collection events, so please keep your eye out for announcements through email and the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully an event will be close enough for you to attend in the not-so-distant future. We are still a small project, but we are growing! 

If you’d like to keep up to date with news about this study (PGP Harvard) as well as other PGP sites around the world, the GET Conference, and the recently announced Open Humans project, you might be interested in following the PersonalGenomes.org blog. It is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP and the recently announced Open Humans project. http://blog.personalgenomes.org

### How can I fund my own genome sequencing? [MODIFY FOR VERITAS OFFER]
At this time we are not set up for participants to fund their own sequencing through the Harvard PGP. However, if you are interested in having your genome sequenced on your own, the Harvard PGP is capable of accepting donated genomes. In order to participate in our project, it is not required that the genome be sequenced through PGP channels only.
   
The Harvard PGP cannot directly recommend or endorse Direct to Consumer (DTC) sequencing providers. However, you may find the following "List of Personal Genome Sequencing and Interpretation Services" a useful place to start your own research into what may be appropriate for you. http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html This list is not necessarily up-to-date, comprehensive, or recommended by the PGP or any affiliated institutions.  

# Microsoft Healthvault
### How do I upload my medical records to Healthvault?

### Does Micrsoft Healthvault update automatically? 
Unfortunately, Healthvault does not automatically update in our system. You can find instructions for updating your Healthvault data here: https://my.pgp-hms.org/phrccr

### How can I upload other Health Records?
If you're able to export PDF, then maybe you can upload that to your profile. You can upload the data here https://my.pgp-hms.org/user_files/new

The data would then be linked to your profile, and if anyone wants to do a deep dive into your health data, it will be there. In the future, there may be the capability of analyzing data with optical character recognition.

# Sample Collection General Information
### Events
No events are scheduled at this time. Please keep your eye on the PersonalGenomes.org blog http://blog.personalgenomes.org for announcements as well as emails from the Harvard PGP.

### Collection event locations and other information about sample donation
We appreciate how enthusiastic participants are about donating samples, and we get asked all the time about kits, if there's a local lab for donations, or whether we can hold events in more locations across the country. We'd love to have collection events in many other locations, and are slowly branching out to explore this. One thing we do is check which regions have the most participants - for this we use the ZIP code in your shipping address in your account. So make sure that's up to date: it'll let us know you're there! You can update that by logging in and going to the "Account" tab and selecting "Shipping address."

One thing participants may not realize is that there is actually a lot more involved than just donating a sample, which is largely why we have gone to the collection event model. Its important to remember that there are many other key elements involved, including processing logistics, sample tracking, and participant identity verification. This is a study where participant data potentially becomes public (and potentially identifiable), and this necessarily requires that certain protocols be followed. 

Our staff is working hard at forging innovative relationships with partners that can perhaps simplify this process, while at the same time solving some of these problems that must be very carefully worked through in order to protect the rights of participants. 


Participants often ask us if they can send us samples via a “kit” or through a lab in their area. Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to accept blood unless it is collected in one of our group events.  Our scale is really small right now, and processing occurs in batches, so group collection events are our only practical method for blood sample collections at this point. We are beginning to gradually host blood collection events in a few major cities, so please keep your eye out for announcements through the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully and event will be closer to you in the not so distant future. 

### I gave a sample already, why am I still being contacted about sample collection events? 
As an organization, we have made a conscious decision to notify everyone in the Harvard PGP about upcoming events regardless of location or donation status for several reasons
   1) It lets participants know that the Harvard PGP is active and growing and keeps them more up to date on our activities. Though we have necessarily been focused on Boston for the majority of our activities to date (funding for research is always tight), that is beginning to change, and we would like our participants to know that.
   2) Broad notification allows people who might be traveling here to donate a sample, and some participants actually make a special trip to Boston to do exactly that!
   3) The emails can often mention that we're planning collections in other places. This not only keeps participants up to date on the growth of the Harvard PGP, but it also allows them to possibly plan future travel for a closer blood collection event. 
   4) Even if a participant can't come to a collection due to location or timing, they might know someone who would like to, and this helps us spread the word about our study. 

However, if you feel that you would no longer like to receive emails from the Harvard PGP, you can select “unsubscribe” on the email you received about the blood draw. You will still be enrolled in the project, but you won’t receive general informational emails from the Harvard PGP or emails like this one that might notify you of specific PGP events. 

If you choose that option, you can continue to keep up to date with news about this study (PGP Harvard) as well as other PGP sites around the world, the GET conference, and the recently announced Open Humans project by following the PersonalGenomes.org blog. It is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP and the recently-announced Open Humans project. http://blog.personalgenomes.org

### How can I withdraw from the Harvard PGP? 

In addition, you are welcome to post any questions, comments, or suggestions you may have to the Personal Genome Project Forum http://forum.personal-genome.org (a participant-driven group that is not officially affiliated with the Harvard PGP). You may find the PGP participant community helpful in this regard. 

###Donation of other genetic data
At this time the Harvard PGP is not set up to accept donation of other genetic data except under special circumstances. We are working on having the capability, however. Please contact us if you have questions.
