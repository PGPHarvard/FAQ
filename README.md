# Work In Progress: PGP FAQ

## Specimens/Sequencing
### When will it be available? 
### spit?
### test kit requests
Participants often ask us if they can send us samples via a “kit” or through a lab or physician in their area. Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to accept blood unless it is collected in one of our group events.  Our scale is really small right now, and processing occurs in batches, so group collection events are our only practical method for blood sample collections at this point. 

We will definitely be letting you know about upcoming collection events, so please keep your eye out for announcements through email and the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully an event will be close enough for you to attend in the not-so-distant future. We are still a small project, but we are growing! 

If you’d like to keep up to date with news about this study (PGP Harvard) as well as other PGP sites around the world, the GET Conference, and the recently announced Open Humans project, you might be interested in following the PersonalGenomes.org blog. It is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP and the recently announced Open Humans project. http://blog.personalgenomes.org

I gave a blood sample, why isn’t it showing on my profile?
All blood samples collected in our blood collection events over the past year or more are in the sequencing pipeline. Some are awaiting sequencing and are safely stored in our freezers, and some are at various stages of the actual sequencing process. 

As you know, sequencing is a lengthy and complex process, and once the sequencing is complete, there is still more that has to be done on our end before your genome is ready to be released to you. Our staff is small, so we have to do the work in batches, thus making the process take longer than we wish it would, and it can often take a year or more.

No events are scheduled at this time. 

## Conferences and Events
# MF2015
This September xx-xx, 2015, the Mind First Foundation will host a very special event entitled _________. The event is open to PGP Participants. Please keep your eye out for announcements through the blog and newsletter. This will be an outstanding event. 

# GET Conference
This year the GET Conference will be held in Vienna, Austria on September 17-19, 2015, and will be the first GET Global Conference. Please check out the website here: http://www.getconference.org 

The GETConference and GETLabs you are familiar with will return to Boston in 2016. Please keep your eye out for annoucements through the PGP blog and our newsletter.

### How is the PGP different from other services like 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA, Ancestry.com, etc.?
We appreciate your participation in our study and understand that there may be some confusion when it comes to trying to compare our study with some of the direct to consumer services like 23andme, FamilyTreeDNA, Ancestry.com, and so on. 

The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate it to the public domain. Analysis is a strong interest in our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain, and so our support for it must be minimal in order to achieve our main goals. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of this data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).


## Special cases (lots of these)	
complicated questions

Health Problems
We deeply appreciate how willing our participants are to publicly share their genetic data. Often participants have become interested in this mission as a result their own genetic disease, and together they are building valuable public data for understanding our genomes.

Unfortunately, our project does not provide medical testing. If you need genetic testing for a suspected genetic disorder you must receive clinical genetic testing through your physician. Our project is regrettably unable to assist individuals in determining the causes of their personal genetic diseases.

Researcher Requests for PGP Data
We've recently created a consolidated database of the Harvard PGP data.  We're in the process of putting a link up to the database from the Harvard PGP site but in the mean time you can get a SQLite version of the database by downloading it from the following page:

  http://curoverse.link/22d61dd43786c65cd175b04ad6954af0+3119/html/index.html

 The gzipped database is called 'hu-pgp.sqlite3.gz'.  The database can also be explored in the browser.  By hitting the 'examples' tab on the left and selecting the 'uploaded_data' entry, you can explore participants uploaded data.  For example, the following query gives results that might have data you're interested in:

select * from uploaded_data where (name like 'LF%' or name like '%exome%')

Some participants have uploaded their 23andMe data but did not label it.  Some of this data can be captured by filtering on names that begin with "LF".

Attached are the results of the above query in the form of CSV files.  The 'download_url' is relative to the 'https://my.pgp-hms.org' site.  For example, a 'download_url' entry of '/user_file/download/671' would translate to 'https://my.pgp-hms.org/user_file/download/671'.

The above query does not necessarily represent a complete list of all exome data available through the Harvard PGP site.  Since participants are able to upload data it is difficult for us to definitively determine which of the uploaded data represents exome data.  With the database snapshot available you'll be able to explore this data yourself and might be able to pick out other exome data that might have been missed in the above query.

If you have any problems accessing the database snapshot or have any further questions, please let us know.

etc.
