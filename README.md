## Specimens/Sequencing
### When will it be available? 
### spit?
### test kit requests
donation of other genetic data
I gave a sample, why isn’t it showing on my profile?
All blood samples collected in our blood collection events over the past year are in the sequencing pipeline. As you know, sequencing is a lengthy and complex process, and once the sequencing is complete, there is still more that has to be done on our end before your genome is ready to be released to you. Our staff is small, so we have to do the work in batches, thus making the process take longer than we wish it would, and it can often take a year or more.   

We appreciate your commitment to this project and your patience. Genomes will be released gradually during the course of this year. 

If you haven’t already, you might be interested in checking out the recently launched Open Humans project. Its another great way to participate. As always, the PersonalGenomes.org blog is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP. 

We hope this helps, and if you have any further questions, please let us know. 

We appreciate your enthusiasm and support of this project.

### How is the PGP different from other services like 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA, Ancestry.com, etc.?
We appreciate your participation in our study and understand that there may be some confusion when it comes to trying to compare our study with some of the direct to consumer services like 23andme, FamilyTreeDNA, Ancestry.com, and so on. 

The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate it to the public domain. Analysis is a strong interest in our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain, and so our support for it must be minimal in order to achieve our main goals. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of this data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).

We hope this helps and appreciate your ongoing support for this study.
