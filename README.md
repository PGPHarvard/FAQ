# Who is the Harvard PGP? 
Volunteer organization? 
What is a research timeline versus commercial?

### Are you still enrolling participants? 
Yes, we are still accepting volunteers and have recently (Aug 2015) reduced the enrollment age from 21 and older to 18 and older largely in response to participant requests. This was recently announced in our blog. [INSERT LINK] You can find out more about participating in our project here: http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up

### The Harvard PGP is a research project. What does that mean? 
[MAYBE WE CAN PUT SOMETHING IN HERE ABOUT EXPECTATIONS, TIME LINES, SOMETHING THAT DEFINES RESEARCH AS OPPOSED TO DTC??? - LOOKING TO HELP EXPECTATIONS HERE]

### Once I join, how can I participate?
Once you are enrolled in the Harvard PGP, there are many ways to participate that are extremely valuable to researchers even before your genome is sequenced. This is often an overlooked component of the Harvard PGP, and as a participant, it is important to recognize that the data you share, with our without a sequenced genome, is still vital to researchers and lays the groundwork for revolutionizing the way human genmoics research is conducted and funded. 

Some of the ways you can participate prior to sequencing:
   * Trait surveys - This standardized data allows researchers to ...  
   * Donate data you already have or may later obtain - by donating your 23andme [GOOD LiST?], or other sequenced data, you ... 
   * Keep your profile up to date - by keeping your data up to date, including medical data and any other data you are willing to share, you provide invaluable resources ....
   * Third-party studies - The Harvard PGP periodically connects participants with other opportunities like  research studies or surveys that might be appropriate or of interest to our participants. All participants qualify for some of these activities and for others, only participants with sequenced genomes can participate. 
   * Conferences and Labs - The Harvard PGP hosts an annual conference and participant-oriented labs event in Boston called the GETConference and GETLabs. In 2015 the event is entitled GET Global and will be held in Vienna, Austria, in order to celebrate our 3 international partners, PGP Canada, PGP UK, and 
   * 
   * [NOTE: I THINK IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A GOOD POSITIVE LIST THAT REINFORCES THAT PARTICIPATION ISN'T JUST SEQUENCING MAYBE IT WILL HELP PUBLIC IMAGE AT LEAST FOR NEW PARTICIPANTS]


### How is the Harvard PGP different from DTC services that provide ancestry data, clinical genome sequencing, or other genomic data?

The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate it to the public domain. Analysis is a strong interest in our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain, and so our support for it must be minimal in order to achieve our main goals. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of this data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).

### Options for US citizens living abroad
If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you are eligible to become a participant in the Harvard PGP project even if you are residing in another country. However, participation in our project might be limited since collection of samples can only be done at this time in group events in the US. At this point we aren’t even able to accept samples collected from local US labs or physicians. Of course, if you happen to be in the US when a collection event is happening, you are more than welcome to attend. 

As a participant, we welcome donated data. So if you are unable to attend a collection event but have other data available you are willing to donate to the project such as health data, completion of our trait surveys, 23andme or other direct to consumer sequencing data, etc., that information is very helpful to researchers as well. 

If you are not already aware, PersonalGenomes.org now has other international partners, and perhaps given your location, one of them may be a good fit for you. They are [Genom Austria](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgenomaustria.at%2Fdas-projekt%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF27AsR2lILccziC0O24BMPmhCmyw), [PGP UK](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fuk%2Fsign-up&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTfygDr4TTAlUtgHFBbVSkXR7Nlw), and [PGP Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fcanada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTmEIQuVqAQeDHRtD47a7GK9hnkg).

Should you still be interested in participating in our study, don’t worry about the address issue for now. Its not required for participation. We use your address to target geographic notification for collection events, and if we start shipping kits again, then we would only be able to support US addresses for that (and then an address would be required to receive a kit).

### Sharing participation issues with family
The following link may be a useful one to share with your family. It is an article published in Genomes Unzipped by Dan Vorhaus discussing the potential impact of public genomics on the families of participants. In this article, he also includes a copy of the letter he sent to his own family.

# Specimens/Sequencing
### When will my genome be available? 
All blood samples collected in our blood collection events over the past year or more are in the sequencing pipeline. Some are awaiting sequencing and are safely stored in our freezers, and some are at various stages of the actual sequencing process. 

As you know, sequencing is a lengthy and complex process, and once the sequencing is complete, there is still more that has to be done on our end before your genome is ready to be released to you. Our staff is small, so we have to do the work in batches, thus making the process take longer than we wish it would, and it can often take a year or more. 

### I gave a blood sample, why isn’t it showing on my profile?
We apologize if your profile does not reflect your sample donation. Please don't be concerned. All donated bllod samples have been logged. Unfortunately, due to our small staff, updating the site to reflect the donation can take time. If too much time has passed, and your sample donation is still not reflected on your profile, please let us know. 

### Whatever happened to my saliva sample?
Several years ago the PGP collected saliva samples from many PGP participants. Those samples are still safely banked, and that is incredibly valuable data that we hope to utilize one day. 

We are a small but growing study, sequencing is costly, and technology is changing rapidly. What we initially set out to do has conceptually stayed constant. However, how we are getting there has had to shift based on real-world variables that are not always within our control. 

We want to impress upon you that your support and efforts have not been wasted at all, and we do not take it for granted. Although it may personally feel that your individual investment has been underutilized until this point, your willingness to join the PGP and to donate samples (whether they were ever sequenced or not) combined with all the other individuals willing to do so, has helped prove to donors and investors that ours is a project worth investing in. 

Our increasing success at this stage is in large part due to many individuals coming together in good faith over the past decade. If you have been following recent events of the Harvard PGP, you will have noticed blood collection events starting to occur across the country, and we only expect those to increase over time and in more locations. In addition, PersonalGenomes.org has recently announced a new location in Austria, adding a fourth member to the family as well as the introduction of OpenHumans.org https://www.openhumans.org  

Our team of researchers are continually seeking funding for sequencing and forging new relationships with industry partners in the hopes of bringing innovative solutions to participant sequencing needs. 

### Test Kit Requests
Participants often ask us if they can send us samples via a “kit” or through a lab or physician in their area. Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to accept blood unless it is collected in one of our group events.  Our scale is really small right now, and processing occurs in batches, so group collection events are our only practical method for blood sample collections at this point. 

We will definitely be letting you know about upcoming collection events, so please keep your eye out for announcements through email and the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully an event will be close enough for you to attend in the not-so-distant future. We are still a small project, but we are growing! 

If you’d like to keep up to date with news about this study (PGP Harvard) as well as other PGP sites around the world, the GET Conference, and the recently announced Open Humans project, you might be interested in following the PersonalGenomes.org blog. It is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP and the recently announced Open Humans project. http://blog.personalgenomes.org

### How can I fund my own genome sequencing? 
At this time we are not set up for participants to fund their own sequencing through the Harvard PGP. However, if you are interested in having your genome sequenced on your own, the Harvard PGP is capable of accepting donated genomes. In order to participate in our project, it is not required that the genome be sequenced through PGP channels only.
   
The Harvard PGP cannot directly recommend or endorse Direct to Consumer (DTC) sequencing providers. However, you may find the following "List of Personal Genome Sequencing and Interpretation Services" a useful place to start your own research into what may be appropriate for you. http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html This list is not necessarily up-to-date, comprehensive, or recommended by the PGP or any affiliated institutions.  

In addition, you are welcome to post any questions, comments, or suggestions you may have to the Personal Genome Project Forum http://forum.personal-genome.org (a participant-driven group that is not officially affiliated with the Harvard PGP). You may find the PGP participant community helpful in this regard. 

###Donation of other genetic data
At this time the Harvard PGP is not set up to accept donation of other genetic data except under special circumstances. We are working on having the capability, however. Please contact us if you have questions.

# Conferences and Special Events
### MF2015
This September xx-xx, 2015, the Mind First Foundation will host a very special event entitled _________. The event is open to PGP Participants. Please keep your eye out for announcements through the blog and newsletter. This will be an outstanding event. 

### GET Conference
This year the GET Conference will be held in Vienna, Austria on September 17-19, 2015, and will be the first GET Global Conference. Please check out the website here: http://www.getconference.org 

The GETConference and GETLabs you are familiar with will return to Boston in 2016. Please keep your eye out for annoucements through the PGP blog http://blog.personalgenomes.org and our periodic newsletters. 

# Sample Collection General Information
### Events
No events are scheduled at this time. Please keep your eye on the PersonalGenomes.org blog http://blog.personalgenomes.org for announcements as well as emails from the Harvard PGP.

### Collection event locations and other information about sample donation
We appreciate how enthusiastic participants are about donating samples, and we get asked all the time about kits, if there's a local lab for donations, or whether we can hold events in more locations across the country. We'd love to have collection events in many other locations, and are slowly branching out to explore this. One thing we do is check which regions have the most participants - for this we use the ZIP code in your shipping address in your account. So make sure that's up to date: it'll let us know you're there! You can update that by logging in and going to the "Account" tab and selecting "Shipping address."

One thing participants may not realize is that there is actually a lot more involved than just donating a sample, which is largely why we have gone to the collection event model. Its important to remember that there are many other key elements involved, including processing logistics, sample tracking, and participant identity verification. This is a study where participant data potentially becomes public (and potentially identifiable), and this necessarily requires that certain protocols be followed. 

Our staff is working hard at forging innovative relationships with partners that can perhaps simplify this process, while at the same time solving some of these problems that must be very carefully worked through in order to protect the rights of participants. 


Participants often ask us if they can send us samples via a “kit” or through a lab in their area. Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to accept blood unless it is collected in one of our group events.  Our scale is really small right now, and processing occurs in batches, so group collection events are our only practical method for blood sample collections at this point. We are beginning to gradually host blood collection events in a few major cities, so please keep your eye out for announcements through the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully and event will be closer to you in the not so distant future. 

### I gave a sample already, why am I still being contacted about sample collection events? 
As an organization, we have made a conscious decision to notify everyone in the Harvard PGP about upcoming events regardless of location or donation status for several reasons
   1) It lets participants know that the Harvard PGP is active and growing and keeps them more up to date on our activities. Though we have necessarily been focused on Boston for the majority of our activities to date (funding for research is always tight), that is beginning to change, and we would like our participants to know that.
   2) Broad notification allows people who might be traveling here to donate a sample, and some participants actually make a special trip to Boston to do exactly that!
   3) The emails can often mention that we're planning collections in other places. This not only keeps participants up to date on the growth of the Harvard PGP, but it also allows them to possibly plan future travel for a closer blood collection event. 
   4) Even if a participant can't come to a collection due to location or timing, they might know someone who would like to, and this helps us spread the word about our study. 

However, if you feel that you would no longer like to receive emails from the Harvard PGP, you can select “unsubscribe” on the email you received about the blood draw. You will still be enrolled in the project, but you won’t receive general informational emails from the Harvard PGP or emails like this one that might notify you of specific PGP events. 

If you choose that option, you can continue to keep up to date with news about this study (PGP Harvard) as well as other PGP sites around the world, the GET conference, and the recently announced Open Humans project by following the PersonalGenomes.org blog. It is a great way to stay in touch with what is happening with the PGP and the recently-announced Open Humans project. http://blog.personalgenomes.org


## Special cases (lots of these)	
complicated questions

# Can the Harvard PGP Help with my Health Problems?
We deeply appreciate how willing our participants are to publicly share their genetic data. Often participants have become interested in this mission as a result their own genetic disease, and together they are building valuable public data for understanding our genomes.

Unfortunately, our project does not provide medical testing. If you need genetic testing for a suspected genetic disorder you must receive clinical genetic testing through your physician. Our project is regrettably unable to assist individuals in determining the causes of their personal genetic diseases.

# Researcher Requests for PGP Data
We've recently created a consolidated database of the Harvard PGP data.  We're in the process of putting a link up to the database from the Harvard PGP site but in the mean time you can get a SQLite version of the database by downloading it from the following page:

  http://curoverse.link/22d61dd43786c65cd175b04ad6954af0+3119/html/index.html

 The gzipped database is called 'hu-pgp.sqlite3.gz'.  The database can also be explored in the browser.  By hitting the 'examples' tab on the left and selecting the 'uploaded_data' entry, you can explore participants uploaded data.  For example, the following query gives results that might have data you're interested in:

select * from uploaded_data where (name like 'LF%' or name like '%exome%')

Some participants have uploaded their 23andMe data but did not label it.  Some of this data can be captured by filtering on names that begin with "LF".

Attached are the results of the above query in the form of CSV files.  The 'download_url' is relative to the 'https://my.pgp-hms.org' site.  For example, a 'download_url' entry of '/user_file/download/671' would translate to 'https://my.pgp-hms.org/user_file/download/671'.

The above query does not necessarily represent a complete list of all exome data available through the Harvard PGP site.  Since participants are able to upload data it is difficult for us to definitively determine which of the uploaded data represents exome data.  With the database snapshot available you'll be able to explore this data yourself and might be able to pick out other exome data that might have been missed in the above query.

If you have any problems accessing the database snapshot or have any further questions, please let us know.
