# General FAQ
### What is the Harvard PGP?
The Harvard Personal Genome Project is the founding pilot project in the PersonalGenomes.org Global Network. Our project hosts publicly shared genomic and health data from thousands of participants across the United States.

### The Harvard PGP is an open science research project. What does that mean?
The Harvard PGP was founded in 2005 with a new vision for human health research. The project is designed to create **public** scientific resources that everyone can access by bringing together genomic, environmental, and human trait data donated by our participants. It is staffed by a small, largely volunteer group of researchers, engineers, and ethicists who are all pioneers in their fields.

We believe strongly that publicly sharing this data is good for science and good for society. It gives researchers access to human health data that is otherwise extremely difficult to access, thus potentially speeding up solutions to important health issues. We also try to connect participants directly with research, education, and citizen science projects that utilize personal genome data.

In order to make this possible, the Harvard PGP has pioneered the use of open consent, in which participants are NOT promised anonymity in recognition of the fact that genomic data is as unique as a fingerprint to an individual and can never be fully anonymized. Participants must go through a rigorous process to ensure that they understand the full extent of the open-ended benefits and risks of making their genetic and trait information publicly available.

To see some examples of the datasets, including whole genomes, available through Harvard PGP, you can see our participant profiles, available at https://my.pgp-hms.org/users; to see examples of the reports provided as a courtesy to participants, see the GET-Evidence Reports available at http://evidence.pgp-hms.org/genomes; for PGP cell lines, see https://catalog.coriell.org/0/Sections/Collections/NIGMS/PGPs.aspx?PgId=772&coll=GM.

### Are you still enrolling participants?
Yes, we are still accepting volunteers age 18 and older. You can find out more about participating in our project here: http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up		
 		 
### Why do I have to get 100% on  your eligibility questionnaire before I can join?
To date, the PGP remains an unprecedented project. No other United States studies are generating and publicly sharing diverse and identifiable personal data. Given this unique position, the Harvard PGP feels strongly that all participants need to understand clearly what the personal implications are before they participate. We also feel strongly that it is our duty to lay the best ethical foundation possible for any future studies that may follow the PGP model.		 To date, the PGP remains an unprecedented project.

### What does it mean to be a PGP Participant?
If you successfully complete this Eligibility Screening and are subsequently enrolled in the PGP, your genetic and trait information will be made available on a publicly accessible website and database. For some participants this will include sample collection for banking for genomic sequencing in the future. However, as we are a research project run by a small and mostly volunteer staff, we cannot guarantee any timeline on sequencing. We encourage participants to consider the full range of possibilities for participating, including filling out phenotype surveys, participating in third-party research and activities, and uploading data such as microbiome data, 23andMe or other direct-to-consumer sequencing, and medical health records.

### What information will be provided to me if my genome is sequenced through the PGP?
Please note that, due to funding and staffing constraints, we are not yet able to sequence all enrolled individuals. 

However, when our project produces genome data for a participant, this typically means:
  * Full "genome" sequence data, not genotyping.
  * Raw data access is provided to participants, in the format we received from the sequencing provider.
  * We also currently provide a semi-automated genome report that describes reported effects for some variants within the genome data.
  * This report is NOT clinical: it is limited in scope and may contain errors.  The database of knowledge for genome variants is incomplete, and some reported effects are erroneous.
  * As described in our consent, genome data will become public 30 days after your have private access. Additional technical files may become public without additional notice.
  * When public, your genome data is associated with your "public profile".
  * Currently, our genomes are produced by Complete Genomics. Technical details about their raw data files are here: http://www.completegenomics.com/customer-support/documentation/100357139-2/
  * We share a genome's raw "sequence" data (variant and coverage information). Large technical files might not be in the initial release. If/when we do make additional files public, you'll have access to these by virtue of knowing your participant ID.

### How is the Harvard PGP different from direct-to-consumer services that provide ancestry data, clinical genome sequencing, or other genomic data?

The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate their data to the public domain. As such, our primary focus is on supporting research and not on the delivery of a product on a set timeframe. Analysis is a strong interest of our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain, and so our support for it must be minimal in order to achieve our main goals. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of genomic data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).

### Should I join?
That is a decision you should make after thoroughly reading and understanding the participation documents on the Harvard PGP site http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up Once you decide to join the Harvard PGP, you will then need to successfully complete the enrollment process. Participation isn't for everyone.

### Sharing participation issues with family
The following link may be a useful one to share with your family. It is an article published in Genomes Unzipped by Dan Vorhaus discussing the potential impact of public genomics on the families of participants. In this article, he also includes a copy of the letter he sent to his own family. http://genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/why-public-genomics-is-not-a-purely-personal-decision.php

### Can I join if I live in another country?
If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you are eligible to become a participant in the Harvard PGP project even if you are residing in another country. However, unless you happen to be in the US when a collection event is happening, you will not be able to donate a sample for sequencing at this time. 

We do, however, welcome donated data, and if you have other data available you are willing to donate to the project such as health data, completion of our trait surveys, 23andme or other direct to consumer sequencing data, etc., that information is very helpful to researchers. 

If you are not already aware, PersonalGenomes.org now has other international partners, and the family is growing. Perhaps one of them may be a good fit. To date they are Genom Austria, PGP UK, and PGP Canada.

Should you still be interested in participating in our study, Harvard PGP, donâ€™t worry about the address issue for now. Its not required for participation. We use your address to target geographic notification for collection events, and if we start shipping kits again, then we would only be able to support US addresses for that (and then an address would be required to receive a kit).
