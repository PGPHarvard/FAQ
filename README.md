# Who is the Harvard PGP? 
The Harvard PGP is the founding pilot project in the PersonalGenomes.org Global Network. Our project hosts publicly shared genomic and health data from thousands of participants across the United States. 

### The Harvard PGP is an open science research project. What does that mean? 
The Harvard PGP was founded in 2005 with a new vision for human health research. The project is designed to create public resources that everyone can access, bringing together genomic, environmental, and human trait data donated by our participants. It is staffed by a small, largely volunteer group of researchers, engineers, and ethicists who are all pioneers in their fields.  

We believe strongly that publicly sharing this data is good for science and good for society. It gives researchers access to human health data that is otherwise extremely difficult to access, thus potentially speeding up solutions to important health issues. We also try to connect participants directly with research, education, and citizen science projects that utilize personal genome data.  

### What does that mean for participants?  
By joining the Harvard PGP, participants agree to publicly share health and trait data with researchers. Should their genome be sequenced by the Harvard PGP, participants will have the opportunity to make that sequenced genome public, or participants may have their genome sequenced privately and donate that data to the PGP. The amount of health and trait data participants share can vary widely by participant, but this is valuable data for research. In addition, the Harvard PGP actively helps put participants together with researchers through third-party activities. 

### How is the Harvard PGP different from DTC services that provide ancestry data, clinical genome sequencing, or other genomic data? 
The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate it to the public domain. Analysis is a strong interest in our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain. Therefore, our support for analysis must be minimal in order to achieve our main goal of data sharing. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of this data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, Promethease, GEDmatch, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).


# Enrollment

### Are you still enrolling participants? 
Yes, we are still accepting volunteers! In August 2015 we even reduced the enrollment age from 21 and older to 18 and older, largely in response to participant requests. This was recently announced in our participant newsletter. You can find out more about participating in our project here: http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up

### Should I join?
That is a decision you should make after thoroughly reading and understanding the participation documents on the Harvard PGP site http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up Once you decide to join the Harvard PGP, you will then need to successfully complete the enrollment process. Participation isn't for everyone. 

### Sharing participation issues with family
The following link may be a useful one to share with your family. It is an article published in Genomes Unzipped by Dan Vorhaus discussing the potential impact of public genomics on the families of participants. In this article, he also includes a copy of the letter he sent to his own family.
http://genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/why-public-genomics-is-not-a-purely-personal-decision.php

### Options for US citizens living abroad
If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you are eligible to become a participant in the Harvard PGP project even if you are residing in another country. However, participation in our project might be limited since collection of samples can only be done at this time in group events in the US. At this point we aren’t even able to accept samples collected from local US labs or physicians. Of course, if you happen to be in the US when a collection event is happening, you are more than welcome to attend. 

As a participant, we welcome donated data. So if you are unable to attend a collection event but have other data available you are willing to donate to the project such as health data, completion of our trait surveys, 23andme or other direct to consumer sequencing data, etc., that information is very helpful to researchers as well. 

If you are not already aware, PersonalGenomes.org now has other international partners, and perhaps given your location, one of them may be a good fit for you. They are [Genom Austria](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgenomaustria.at%2Fdas-projekt%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF27AsR2lILccziC0O24BMPmhCmyw), [PGP UK](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fuk%2Fsign-up&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTfygDr4TTAlUtgHFBbVSkXR7Nlw), and [PGP Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fcanada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTmEIQuVqAQeDHRtD47a7GK9hnkg).

Should you still be interested in participating in our study, don’t worry about the address issue for now. Its not required for participation. We use your address to target geographic notification for collection events, and if we start shipping kits again, then we would only be able to support US addresses for that (and then an address would be required to receive a kit).

### Why do I have to get 100% on  your eligibility questionnaire before I can join?
To date, the PGP remains an unprecedented project. No other United States studies are generating and publicly sharing diverse and identifiable personal data. Given this unique position, the Harvard PGP feels strongly that all participants need to understand clearly what the personal implications are before they participate. We also feel strongly that it is our duty to lay the best ethical foundation possible for any future studies that may follow the PGP model.

It is critical in groundbreaking studies like this one that participants have a strong understanding of the complex, nontrivial risks involved in participation, and that necessarily requires a significant consent process. 


### Once I join, how can I participate?
Once you are enrolled in the Harvard PGP, there are many ways to participate that are extremely valuable to researchers even before you have a sequenced genome. This is often an overlooked component of the Harvard PGP, and as a participant, it is important to recognize that the data you share, with our without a sequenced genome, is still vital to researchers and lays the groundwork for revolutionizing the way human genmoics research is conducted and funded. 

Some of the ways you can participate prior to sequencing:
   * Trait surveys - This standardized data sets a foundation for understanding more about your "phenotype" and helps establish a prevalence and associations for these various traits and diseases in participants.
   * Trait data - This will be collected via online questionnaires, uploading of your personal health record (PHR), and other platforms. Information gathered includes allergies, immunizations, personal medical history, medications, physical traits and measurements, diet, ethnicity/ancestry, lifestyle, environmental exposures and other traits. 
   * Donate data you already have or may later obtain - by donating your 23andme, Ancestry DNA, or other sequencing or genotyping data you may have obtained elsewhere.
   * Keep your profile up to date - by keeping your data up to date, including medical data and any other data you are willing to share, you provide invaluable resources to researchers.
   * Third-party studies - The Harvard PGP periodically connects participants with other opportunities like  research studies or surveys that might be appropriate or of interest to our participants. All participants qualify for some of these activities and for others, only participants with sequenced genomes can participate. 
   * Conferences and Labs - The Harvard PGP hosts an annual conference and participant-oriented labs event in Boston called the GETConference and GETLabs. In 2015 the event was entitled GET Global and was held in Vienna, Austria, to celebrate our 3 international partners, PGP Canada, PGP UK, and Genom Austria. We also partnered with the Mind First Foundation for the first MindEx Conference and PGPalooza, another annual Boston event open to PGP participants! http://mindfirstfoundation.org/mindex2015/ These events directly put researchers and participants face to face. 

### How can I withdraw from the Harvard PGP? 
You are free to decide at any time that you no longer want your tissue samples, DNA sequence data, cell lines or other information to be used as part of this study. However, it may not be possible to prevent the future use of your data, cell lines and/or other information in certain circumstances. For more information on this, please refer to the consent for participation PDF https://my.pgp-hms.org/static/PGP_Consent_2015-05-05_online_stamped.pdf 

In order to withdraw from the Harvard PGP, all you have to do is log into your PGP account and select withdraw under the Account tab. https://my.pgp-hms.org 

# Specimens/Sequencing
### In what order are participants sequenced? 
Once you have passed the enrollment requirements for participation in the PGP, there are no selection or prioritization criteria other than "the ability to give a sample at a collection event" that determine whether a participant would potentially have a genome sequenced and returned to them. There is no prioritization in response to donations, and also no prioritization based on when a participant joined the project (i.e. there is no "queue"). Sequencing is still a costly and time-consuming process, and it occurs as resources are available. 

While we don’t prioritize sequencing in return for donations, participants are welcome to pursue sequencing through third parties and donate their data to the PGP http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html or participate in the recently announced sequencing opportunity for PGP participants through Veritas Genetics http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veritas-genetics-breaks-1000-whole-genome-barrier-300150585.html

### When will my genome be available? 
All blood samples collected in our blood collection events over the past year or more are in the sequencing pipeline. Some are awaiting sequencing and are safely stored in our freezers, and some are at various stages of the actual sequencing process. 

As you know, sequencing is a lengthy and complex process, and once the sequencing is complete, there is still more that has to be done on our end before your genome is ready to be released to you. Our staff is small, so we have to do the work in batches, thus making the process take longer than we wish it would, and it can often take a year or more. 

### What will I recieve from the Harvard PGP when I get my genome sequence? 
When our project produces genome data for a participant, this typically means:
   * Full "genome" sequence data, not genotyping.
   * Raw data access is provided to participants, in the format we received from the sequencing provider.
   * We also currently provide a semi-automated genome report that describes reported effects for some variants within the genome data.
   * This report is NOT clinical: it is limited in scope and may contain errors. The database of knowledge for genome variants is incomplete, and some reported effects are erroneous.
   * As described in our consent, genome data will become public 30 days after your have private access. Additional technical files may become public without additional notice.
   * When public, your genome data is associated with your "public profile".
   * Currently, our genomes are produced by Complete Genomics. Technical details about their raw data files are here: http://www.completegenomics.com/customer-support/documentation/100357139-2/ 
   * We share a genome's raw "sequence" data (variant and coverage information). Large technical files might not be in the initial release. If/when we do make additional files public, you'll have access to these by virtue of knowing your participant ID.

### I gave a blood sample, why isn’t it showing on my profile?
We apologize if your profile does not reflect your sample donation. Please don't be concerned. All donated bllod samples have been logged. Unfortunately, due to our small staff, updating the site to reflect the donation can take time. If too much time has passed, and your sample donation is still not reflected on your profile, please let us know. 

### Whatever happened to my saliva sample?
Several years ago the PGP collected saliva samples from many PGP participants. Those samples are still safely banked, and that is incredibly valuable data that we hope to utilize one day. 

We are a small but growing study, sequencing is costly, and technology is changing rapidly. What we initially set out to do has conceptually stayed constant. However, how we are getting there has had to shift based on real-world variables that are not always within our control. 

We want to impress upon you that your support and efforts have not been wasted at all, and we do not take it for granted. Although it may personally feel that your individual investment has been underutilized until this point, your willingness to join the PGP and to donate samples (whether they were ever sequenced or not) combined with all the other individuals willing to do so, has helped prove to donors and investors that ours is a project worth investing in. 

Our increasing success at this stage is in large part due to many individuals coming together in good faith over the past decade. If you have been following recent events of the Harvard PGP, you will have noticed blood collection events starting to occur across the country, and we only expect those to increase over time and in more locations. In addition, PersonalGenomes.org has recently announced a new location in Austria, adding a fourth member to the family as well as the introduction of OpenHumans.org https://www.openhumans.org  

Our team of researchers are continually seeking funding for sequencing and forging new relationships with industry partners in the hopes of bringing innovative solutions to participant sequencing needs. 

### Test Kits
At this time, we do not have test kits available. We are working on options that will make donations of samples easier for participants, and as soon as something becomes avaiable, we will let you know. Until then, we will continue to notify participants about upcoming collection events, so please keep your eye out for announcements through email and the PGP site https://my.pgp-hms.org and hopefully an event will be close enough for you to attend in the not-so-distant future. 


### How can I fund my own genome sequencing?
At this time we are not set up for participants to fund their own sequencing through the Harvard PGP. However, if you are interested in having your genome sequenced on your own, the Harvard PGP is capable of accepting donated genomes. In order to participate in our project, it is not required that the genome be sequenced through PGP channels only.

Participants are welcome to pursue sequencing through third parties and donate their data to the PGP. The Harvard PGP cannot directly recommend or endorse Direct to Consumer (DTC) sequencing providers. However, you may find the following "List of Personal Genome Sequencing and Interpretation Services" a useful place to start your own research into what may be appropriate for you. http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html This list is not necessarily up-to-date, comprehensive, or recommended by the PGP or any affiliated institutions. 

Participants may obtain sequencing by participating in the recently announced sequencing opportunity for PGP participants through Veritas Genetics http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veritas-genetics-breaks-1000-whole-genome-barrier-300150585.html Participants are welcome to go to Veritas directly or wait until the opportunity is set up through the Harvard PGP as a third party activity in the coming weeks.  
   
   
###Donation of other genetic data
At this time the Harvard PGP is not set up to accept donation of other genetic data except under special circumstances. We are working on having the capability, however. Please contact us if you have questions.
