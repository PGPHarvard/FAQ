# Who is the Harvard PGP? 
The Harvard PGP is the founding pilot project in the PersonalGenomes.org Global Network. Our project hosts publicly shared genomic and health data from thousands of participants across the United States. 

### The Harvard PGP is an open science research project. What does that mean? 
The Harvard PGP was founded in 2005 with a new vision for human health research. The project is designed to create public resources that everyone can access, bringing together genomic, environmental, and human trait data donated by our participants. It is staffed by a small, largely volunteer group of researchers, engineers, and ethicists who are all pioneers in their fields.  

We believe strongly that publicly sharing this data is good for science and good for society. It gives researchers access to human health data that is otherwise extremely difficult to access, thus potentially speeding up solutions to important health issues. We also try to connect participants directly with research, education, and citizen science projects that utilize personal genome data.  

### What does that mean for participants?  
[meaning what does participating in a research project AND a revolutionary idea of open science/sharing mean for participants in terms of timeline, effects on how research is conducted in the future, etc?

### How is the Harvard PGP different from DTC services that provide ancestry data, clinical genome sequencing, or other genomic data? 
[not sure how to word this] 
The PGP's goal is to accelerate research into human health and biology by collecting and sharing genomes and other data from people who have generously chosen to donate it to the public domain. Analysis is a strong interest in our participants, but it's also expensive to perform and maintain, and so our support for it must be minimal in order to achieve our main goals. You may want to consider various commercial services that perform interpretations of this data, including 23andme, Family Tree DNA, or other third party analysis tools (many of these are listed by 23andyou: http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty).

# Enrollment

### Are you still enrolling participants? 
Yes, we are still accepting volunteers and have recently (Aug 2015) reduced the enrollment age from 21 and older to 18 and older largely in response to participant requests. This was recently announced in our blog. [INSERT LINK] You can find out more about participating in our project here: http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/sign-up

### Why do I have to get 100% on  your eligibility questionnaire before I can join?
To date, the PGP remains an unprecedented project. No other United States studies are generating and publicly sharing diverse and identifiable personal data. Given this unique position, the Harvard PGP feels strongly that all participants need to understand clearly what the personal implications are before they participate. We also feel strongly that it is our duty to lay the best ethical foundation possible for any future studies that may follow the PGP model.

It is critical in groundbreaking studies like this one that participants have a strong understanding of the complex, nontrivial risks involved in participation, and that necessarily requires a significant consent process. 

### Once I join, how can I participate?
Once you are enrolled in the Harvard PGP, there are many ways to participate that are extremely valuable to researchers even before your genome is sequenced. This is often an overlooked component of the Harvard PGP, and as a participant, it is important to recognize that the data you share, with our without a sequenced genome, is still vital to researchers and lays the groundwork for revolutionizing the way human genmoics research is conducted and funded. 

Some of the ways you can participate prior to sequencing:
   * Trait surveys - This standardized data allows researchers to ...  
   * Donate data you already have or may later obtain - by donating your 23andme [GOOD LiST?], or other sequenced data, you ... 
   * Keep your profile up to date - by keeping your data up to date, including medical data and any other data you are willing to share, you provide invaluable resources ....
   * Third-party studies - The Harvard PGP periodically connects participants with other opportunities like  research studies or surveys that might be appropriate or of interest to our participants. All participants qualify for some of these activities and for others, only participants with sequenced genomes can participate. 
   * Conferences and Labs - The Harvard PGP hosts an annual conference and participant-oriented labs event in Boston called the GETConference and GETLabs. In 2015 the event is entitled GET Global and will be held in Vienna, Austria, in order to celebrate our 3 international partners, PGP Canada, PGP UK, and

   * [NOTE: I THINK IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A GOOD POSITIVE LIST THAT REINFORCES THAT PARTICIPATION ISN'T JUST SEQUENCING MAYBE IT WILL HELP PUBLIC IMAGE AT LEAST FOR NEW PARTICIPANTS]

### Options for US citizens living abroad
If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you are eligible to become a participant in the Harvard PGP project even if you are residing in another country. However, participation in our project might be limited since collection of samples can only be done at this time in group events in the US. At this point we aren’t even able to accept samples collected from local US labs or physicians. Of course, if you happen to be in the US when a collection event is happening, you are more than welcome to attend. 

As a participant, we welcome donated data. So if you are unable to attend a collection event but have other data available you are willing to donate to the project such as health data, completion of our trait surveys, 23andme or other direct to consumer sequencing data, etc., that information is very helpful to researchers as well. 

If you are not already aware, PersonalGenomes.org now has other international partners, and perhaps given your location, one of them may be a good fit for you. They are [Genom Austria](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgenomaustria.at%2Fdas-projekt%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF27AsR2lILccziC0O24BMPmhCmyw), [PGP UK](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fuk%2Fsign-up&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTfygDr4TTAlUtgHFBbVSkXR7Nlw), and [PGP Canada](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalgenomes.org%2Fcanada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFTmEIQuVqAQeDHRtD47a7GK9hnkg).

Should you still be interested in participating in our study, don’t worry about the address issue for now. Its not required for participation. We use your address to target geographic notification for collection events, and if we start shipping kits again, then we would only be able to support US addresses for that (and then an address would be required to receive a kit).

### Sharing participation issues with family
The following link may be a useful one to share with your family. It is an article published in Genomes Unzipped by Dan Vorhaus discussing the potential impact of public genomics on the families of participants. In this article, he also includes a copy of the letter he sent to his own family.

# Specimens/Sequencing
### In what order are participants sequenced? 
Once you have passed the enrollment requirements for participation in the PGP, there are no selection or prioritization criteria other than "the ability to give a sample at a collection event" that determine whether a participant would potentially have a genome sequenced and returned to them. There is no prioritization in response to donations, and also no prioritization based on when a participant joined the project (i.e. there is no "queue"). Sequencing is still a costly and time-consuming process, and it occurs as resources are available. 

While we don’t prioritize sequencing in return for donations, participants are welcome to pursue sequencing through third parties and donate their data to the PGP http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/genome_services.html or participate in the recently announced sequencing opportunity for PGP participants through Veritas Genetics http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veritas-genetics-breaks-1000-whole-genome-barrier-300150585.html

### What will I recieve from the Harvard PGP when I get my genome sequence? 
When our project produces genome data for a participant, this typically means:
   * Full "genome" sequence data, not genotyping.
   * Raw data access is provided to participants, in the format we received from the sequencing provider.
   * We also currently provide a semi-automated genome report that describes reported effects for some variants within the genome data.
   * This report is NOT clinical: it is limited in scope and may contain errors. The database of knowledge for genome variants is incomplete, and some reported effects are erroneous.
   * As described in our consent, genome data will become public 30 days after your have private access. Additional technical files may become public without additional notice.
   * When public, your genome data is associated with your "public profile".
   * Currently, our genomes are produced by Complete Genomics. Technical details about their raw data files are here: http://www.completegenomics.com/customer-support/documentation/100357139-2/ 
   * We share a genome's raw "sequence" data (variant and coverage information). Large technical files might not be in the initial release. If/when we do make additional files public, you'll have access to these by virtue of knowing your participant ID.

## Can the Harvard PGP Help with my Health Problems?
We deeply appreciate how willing our participants are to publicly share their genetic data. Often participants have become interested in this mission as a result their own genetic disease, and together they are building valuable public data for understanding our genomes.

Unfortunately, our project does not provide medical testing. If you need genetic testing for a suspected genetic disorder you must receive clinical genetic testing through your physician. Our project is regrettably unable to assist individuals in determining the causes of their personal genetic diseases.
